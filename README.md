These are the FORTRAN codes Andrea Cremese wrote between Oct 2005 - Apr 2006 at the CiFi - CIFI - Centro Interdipartimentale di Fluidodinamica e Idraulici, Udine University, Italy. http://158.110.32.35/

The objective was to code a suite of tools to study the particle dispersion in Jet In Cross Flow (when a flow mixes at an angle with a larger flow) and explore if, by tuning the particle input with the formation of voritcal structure, it was possible to improve mixing. Promising and satisfactory results were found. Potential applications: from automotive to medical to mechanical to process.

Fortran was used as coding language due to the presence of libraries and for its performances in terms of processing time.

The Computer Fluid Dynamics simulation and the analysis of its outcomes constituted the final thesis for Andrea's Master in Mechanical Engineering, which he obtained with 110 cum laude /110 (not bad, uh?).

The results of this work were subsequently published by AIChE (American Institute of Chemical Engineers) and won the 2007 Knapp Award by the American Society for Mecanical Engineering for "Outstanding original paper resulting directly from analytical or laboratory research".

The only piece of code not originaly written by Andrea Cremese for this project was the fluid engine simulator (Navier Stokes Equations solver) which was Developed at Stanford and sponsored by the  National Science Foundation. This did not include a particle tracker at the time. Alfredo Soldati and Marina Campolo were instrumental though in the process. 

Note that the scope of the project incldued as well the validation of all simulation coding written.
