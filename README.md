These are the FORTRAN codes I wrote between Oct 2005 - Apr 2006 at the CiFi - CIFI - Centro Interdipartimentale di Fluidodinamica e Idraulici - http://158.110.32.35/ Udine University Italy.

The results of this work was published by AiChE (American Institute of Chemical Engineers) and won the 2007 Knapp Award by the American Society for Mecanical Engineering for ""Outstanding original paper resulting directly from analytical or laboratory research"".

The only piece of code not originaly written by Andrea Cremese for this project was the fluid engine simulator (Navier Stokes Equations solver) which was Developed at Stanford and sponsored by the  National Science Foundation. 

Note that the scope of the project incldued as well the validation of all simulation coding written.
